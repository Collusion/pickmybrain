To install this binary package:

1. Copy the executables (xpdf, pdftotext, etc.) to to /usr/local/bin.

2. Copy the man pages (*.1 and *.5) to /usr/local/man/man1 and
   /usr/local/man/man5.

3. Copy the sample-xpdfrc file to /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc.  You'll
   probably want to edit its contents (as distributed, everything is
   commented out) -- see xpdfrc(5) for details.
